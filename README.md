# dsa-hash-table

A custom hash table (dictionary) implementation in Python using **separate chaining**.  
Includes a `LetterFrequencyMap` utility to analyze text frequency using the hash table.

## Concepts Covered
- Hashing and collision handling
- Load factor and resizing
- Real-world usage of hash maps in Python dictionaries

---

## Features
- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `hash()` for simplicity
- Stores key-value pairs using chaining
- Demonstrates real-world use in letter frequency analysis

---

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 hash_table.py
python3 LetterFrequencyMap.py input.txt
